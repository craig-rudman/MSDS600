    "# Week 8 assignment: NLP on social media data\n",
    "\n",
    "Take our social media we collected last week and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- extract the sentiment scores of the titles of the posts\n",
    "    - you can use the keyword method, Python packages, or other methods to extract the sentiment scores\n",
    "- plot a histogram of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- look at descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- examine the text for some of the highest and lowest sentiment scores\n",
    "- write a short analysis of the results and our process, as well as propose one idea for something we could use this data for\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional advanced challenges:\n",
    "- Compare different sentiment analysis methods (e.g. textblob and VADER). Does one seem to work better than another?\n",
    "- Get the sentiments of the comments for each post. We can do a lot with this, such as:\n",
    "    - look at the average sentiment for each post and compare it with the sentiment of the title and/or text\n",
    "    - look at the distribution of sentiments for each post and find the posts with the widest range of sentiments (controversial posts)\n",
    "- Examine the subjectivity of our data (e.g. using textblob)\n",
    "- Use topic modeling on the posts\n",
    "    - you can also add in the comments to the topic model\n",
    "- Look at the most frequent words for positive and negative sentiment posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is no assignment solution file for this week."

I went to my first Lawrence concert, and her first ever concert, at Radio City Music Hall, so I hold these lyrics close:\\n\\n#1 - 23 - \"Waiting, I'm waiting. Mice are complaining\"\\n\\nYes, mice are complaining. She was 5 and that's what she heard and sang so it's adorable.

As I get older, time flies by faster and faster. You don't see people as much. You might talk to some people once a week, once a month, maybe only once a year. You don't know when the last time will be. Tell the people around you that you love them. Life is too short.\\n\\nLastly, I just have to throw this out there too.\\n\\n#3 - Guy I Used To Be the leading line and title of the track \"Goodbye to the guy I used to be.\" \\n\\nHonestly, the entire chorus. This is such a clever song because it's written open ended. I imagine it's a love song for Clyde. Or at least, it's interpreted that way for most I'd think. For me? I guess you could still call it that but I think of it in terms of my transition to becoming a father. Not just for my aforementioned older daughter, but my younger one as well, and being there for my wife too. My dreams and desires have changed. They are the only things that matter to me.\\n \\nAnyhow, it's really kind of you to do this give away. It would be awesome to win! But good luck to everyone!</td>\n",

When they play shows though all the songs will sound more authentic. At the end of the day, it’s really cool to see how talented they are both live and in the studio.

Also, be awesome to collect all best recordings if no one recorded it all. \\n\\nThis was an amazing concert. Set list was incredible. \\n\\nIt was cool to hear them say this was where they saw their first concert. I brought my daughter and it's her first. It's really special to me so would love to have as many recordings as possible. Not even just the songs but the crowd work between songs was great too!\\n\\nSet List I remember right now. I might have mixed some of them up and probably missed a song. They did every Family Business song except Circle Back and Conflict Resolution. They played 1 cover and 6 or more songs from earlier records. All great choices. I was so happy to hear Many More.\\n\\nMain Office\\n- Family Business\\n- Do\\n- I'm confident I'm Insecure\\n- Casualty\\n- Freckle (crowd song choice between Shot, Make A Move and Freckle - each VIP folks chose off different albums)\\n- Guy I Used to Be\\n- BREAK for video of Jordan\\n- Hip Replacement\\n- Death of Me\\n- Funeral\\n\\nAcoustic Office\\n- Promotion\\n- Weather\\n- Something in the Water\\n\\n\\nMain Office\\n- So Damn Fast\\n- Get Busy (Sean Paul Cover)\\n- Many More\\n- 23\\n- Do You Wanna Do Nothing With Me?\\n- Don't Lose Sight\\n\\nEncore\\n- Heartburn\\n- Watcha Want\\n\\nThere was another break for \"logistics\" and a few other good Family Business videos too that were fun.

It’s just different. They mentioned that some songs on the new album have like 200-400 layers/tracks but it seems like they’re trying to take their style and elevate it a bit. When they play shows though all the songs will sound more authentic. At the end of the day, it’s really cool to see how talented they are both live and in the studio. The Diner (Clyde, Jonny, Jordan) have been producing some great songs for other artists and it seems like they’ve really dived deep into the backend production and are updating Lawrence’s album sound.

    "In this week's assignmment, I'm using data from a subreddit for fans of the band \"Lawrence\". Fans of the band are generally extremely upbeat and positive; they LOVE this band and we should expect posts and comments in this subreddit to skew positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by importing libraries:\n",
    "* **pandas:** working with dataframes, accessing data stores, data analytics, and data visualization\n",
    "* **matplotlib:** data visualization\n",
    "* **sqlite3:** a lightweight, SQL compliant, disk-based database implemented in C\n",
    "* **vaderSentiment:** VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is an open-source sentiment analysis tool trained on social media\n",
    "https://vadersentiment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I opened a connection to the local database in which data from posts and comments has been stored.  From that connection, I created dataframes from the tables 'posts' and 'comments'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then constructed an instance of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class from the vaderSentiment library and applied the sentiment analizer to each of the two dataframes. For the sake of learning, I collected the full sentiment profile as well as the compound score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I plotted histograms of both titles and comments. As expected, the sentiment scores for both titles and comments skewed positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the top positive and negative results from both tables, one thing became very clear... some words in other contexts might score very negative, but in this context are neutral or positive.  Some examples from post titles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They KILLED it in ATL!\n",
    "In this context, KILLED means that the band performed extremely well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clyde Lawrence singing Don’t Lose Sight while Gracie was out sick\n",
    "Being 'out sick' is merely descriptive, and so should be neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lawrence discord - chat with fans and Linus Lawrence himself!!!\n",
    "In this context, 'discord' refers to the platform not to contention between parties\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some ideas about how this data could be used\n",
    "In a data science context, one might use this data to train models specificially on the lexicon of music fans.  They might have jargon that in other contexts are negative, but in this context are positive ( e.g. \"they killed\", \"they slayed\", \"check out this sick cover!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In a business context, one might use this analysis to assess how the band connects with their audience on an emotional level and that might inform how they promote the band in the future. From the top three scores in the comments section, three audience personas are clearly on display:\n",
    "* Father and daughter:  the band is family-friendly and the songs tend to be happy and upbeat. Families can enjoy Lawrence together and the music brings them closer.\n",
    "* Audiophile: in the second top comment, the audiophile enjoys the variety of mixes that the band produces... the studio productions, the live versions, and the stripped-down acoustic sets\n",
    "* The Lonely Heart:  this type of person finds comfort in the community of kind-hearted fands that Lawrence builds\n",
    "\n",
    "A marketing team could use this information to promote to these different market segments.\n",
